        <h2>My life, My choices</h2>
        <p> There can be a lot said about life and it's changes...for one, you never know what is coming next! Life is a journey completed day-by-day, with results varying with individual choices. We don't think of the consequences neccessarily as much as we should and therefore, when problems arise, we often are in denial of our own participation in the scheme of things and the way it turns out. And when life, itself, gives you a bad hand, omgoodness! The blame can't be deflected fast enough.
        </p>
     

        <p> So, hear me when I say that I understand most of the problems that teenage parents have, they most likely created for themselves. They haphazardly choose to have sex, mainly with someone they don't know well or even like, which results in pregnancy. A possible outcome of which could be a child who will likely not have one parent in their life due to conflict of personal desires of the other parent.</p>

        <p>I say this because at 15 years old I chose to have sex, chose to get pregnant, and chose who I was going to get pregnant by. Yup. I chose to get pregnant at 15 years old. And I think that it was one of the BEST decisions I've made in my life. I have NO regrets. However, that's me. I made specific choices in my life early on that assisted and supported me in my creation of my own family. The specific choices I made in my life were mine. I cannot say the same for anyone else. I am me.
        </p>
    
        <p> This website is a small representation of the experiences that made me who I am. I grow as a person everyday. I am unashamed of what I've been through and the magnificient person I've become. </p>
