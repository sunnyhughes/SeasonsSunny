                 <h2>Higher Education</h2>
                <div class="story">
                    <p>From graduating high school at 16 years old to being accepted into college at 17, I knew that my education would be key to my family succeeding. A well educated mind can rule the world. I planned my majors around something that would benenfit my children even before I finished college: Early Childhood Education and Human Services (Social work). I always felt like my life had been centered around helping others, help themselves even as a child. And I got the perfect opportunity to help others at age 16 when I worked for Louisville Metro Housing Authority Special Programs. I worked in a program called StarPoints Nurturing Program where I got to engage and assist other teenage parents and single parents involved in the court sytem, learn how to be good parents. There, under the supervision of one of the best women I've ever had the pleasure to meet in life, Johnella P. Wimberly, I was introduced to a world of caring and sharing, that I had never known. And she truly changed my life for the best. I love her. I miss her. </p>

                    <h2>Working for Them</h2>
                <div class="story">
                    <p>After my season of StarPoints, I went on to JCPS for substitute early childhood teacher. Being that it was a temporary position, I wasn't garaunteed hours so I also went to work at Toys-R-Us. Boom!! Another blessing comes our way. My position(s) at TRU allowed me to care for my children better than I'd ever imagined. I recieved benefits from the start
                    with advancements possible at every level including major discounts on everything in the store. I went from being a cashier to apparel supervisor, to apparel manager to early morning shift manager, all within 3 years. Toys R Us gave me access to deals and opportunities that let me be extra generous with my children. It was totally the perfect job for a young mother being that I got a chance to still be childish all while being an adult. Loved it!
