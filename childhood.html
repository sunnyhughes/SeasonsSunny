             <h2>Only Girl</h2>
            <div class="story">
                <p>I was born in July 1979 to a woman who had already had 2 boys. Hmmph, big brothers.I could take 'em or leave 'em. There was also a marriage to a guy that was NO ONE'S father in either 1978 or 1979. IDK. We lived for a few years in between Louisville KY and Indianapolis, IN. Mama chose to settle in Louisville after having two more sons, one in each state. I was dead smack in the middle and my life reflected my birth placement. It seemed like being born in the middle was an automatic divider between me and my brothers. And it didn't seem to help that I was the only one who didn't have a father. The story goes that my "father" was a married man who had gotten killed in Indianapolis in August of 1979, two weeks after I was born.</p>

                <h2>Read, Write, and Draw</h2>
            <div class="story">
                 <p>I could say that not having a father caused a little toughening up of my girlie side but I'd would be lying. I say I was a tomboy because I have 4 frigging brothers. Duh. Cars, trucks, basketballs and flips were all more interesting. It just seemed more fun to play wrestling rather than sit on the steps wearing a frilly dress with ruffle socks. I feel Mama really hated that she couldn't dress me up like a doll because that was the only thing I think she knew to do with a female child. Unfortunately, that just <b>wasn't</b> me. 

                There's quite a few things that "weren't me", meaning there were  many characteristics that I had that didn't fit my familial mold. I was a geeky girl who liked to read, paint, draw, and collect comic books. I skipped 2 high school grades twice, made Dean's List and Who's Who my junior & senior semesters. I couldn't have painted a bigger nerd bullseye on my own back if I wanted to. Welp!</p>

            <h2>Childhood Dreams</h2>
            <div class="story">
                <p> I had thoughts of how it would be to be a mother for as long as I can remember. I beleive the first time being somewhere between 6 and 8 years old. I always felt I was alone. I wanted to have a family that wouldn't treat me bad or leave me alone. I had a plan too! My plan was to finish high school and move into an apartment with my two best friends, Shawna & Sara, after graduating. I would have the baby while focusing on my writing and art and get accepted into a School of Arts program. By 15, I had written several award worthy short stories that were part of my english portfolio. I had 2 articles published in local and national publications about teen parenting and artwork on display in a Louisville well-known corporate office building. I felt I was going to be fully set to begin being a mother and an adult, without worrying about my education.
