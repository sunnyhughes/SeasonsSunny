This is a website designed to tell my story as a teen parent. It has some of my stories as well as pictures of my family. The webpage is fairly simple with not a lot of features as I am just begining my journey in FEWD.

I am an entry level front end web developer and self guided student. I am interested in FEWD because the world is moving towards a more technological era and I want to be a part of it. I want to produce apps that help certain groups of people such as abused or homeless. I am learning coding also because its a broad field and I know I can make a difference in it.

I use the css items of: collasped menu, media quieries,  and images responsive. I was still learning to use these items upon submission of this project.

I use the javascript to make the menus reactive and clickable, the movement throughout the site, and events to happen.

This is my first project and I worked hard to learn what things I did. I will continue to practice and hone my skills as a FEWD and in time create beautiful, functionable apps and websites.
